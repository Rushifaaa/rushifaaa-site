## About the Project
It's just a site for me, just like a "personal" site.


##Getting Started
This is the `master` branch so to start you need the `backend` and the `frontend`.  
**Frontend** is in the `frontend` branch and the **backend** is in the `backend` branch. 

To start you need to clone this repo. 
`git clone https://www.github.com/Rushifaaa/rushifaaa-site` 
 
You just need to be in the directory. 
`cd rushifaaa-site` 

Now you can switch to the `backend` or `frontend` branch. 
`git checkout backend` or `frontend` 

Now just type `yarn` to get all dependencies.

`yarn start` starts the `frontend/backend`
